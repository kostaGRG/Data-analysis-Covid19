% As we can see from the outputs and the plots, there is no rule that 5
% countries agree to. Each country has its own behaviour, as there are
% countries such as Hungary, where it seems that the results from 2020 and
% 2021 are similar, but if we observe Ireland's results, we can see that
% there is a big difference in positivity rates, where 2021's positivity
% rate is greater than 2020's. Finally, Italy gives us an example of the
% opposite situation, where 2021's positivity rate is lower than 2020's.
% So we are sure that the results differ from country to country.
